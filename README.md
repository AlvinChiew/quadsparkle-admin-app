# Quad Sparkle Admin Web App

A custom-made Admin Portal for a car wash business to track sales and transactions.

This application is built with Flutter, with a plan to share the same code base for a mobile app. It runs on a self-hosted Ubuntu Server and is exposed to the internet through a secured connection via Cloudflare Tunnel. All data has two layers of backup: real-time synchronization and daily snapshots.
